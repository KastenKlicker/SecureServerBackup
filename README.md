<img alt="GitHub all releases" src="https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/kastenklicker/secureserverbackup/total?color=green&logo=github&style=flat-square">

Backup your server fast without lags or freeze and upload them to a SFTP/FTPS server.

### This plugin will be completely refactored in some time.

At the moment automatic and command issued backups with upload over SFTP are working.

Upload over sftp and performance testing is planned.

Runs on Spigot, but use PaperMC as server software for better performance.
